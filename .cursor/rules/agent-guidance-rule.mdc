3. [ticket_action_plan.md](mdc:docs/ticket_action_plan.md) has detailed action plan for each implementation step.

## Development Methodology
4. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:
   - Write tests first that define expected behavior
   - Implement the minimum code needed to pass the tests
   - Run tests and verify they pass
   - Refactor code while ensuring tests continue to pass
   - Repeat for each new feature

## Code Quality
5. All code must have appropriate docstrings and comments.
6. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
7. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## Version Control
